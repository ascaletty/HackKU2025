#How to run it
##Necessary Libraries
libraries used:
[Discord's .py library](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html) 
[dotenv for key management](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)
[pandas for data processing](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)
[asyncio for asynchronous input and output](https://pypi.org/project/asyncio/)
Many more were used for ML training and data visualization, but these libraries are the only one's required to make the discord bot run
